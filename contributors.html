			<p align="justify">Arief Wicaksana was born in 1989 in Semarang, Indonesia. He lived in Jakarta until his parents decided to move to Tangerang when he was 7 years old. Arief stayed in Tangerang until he finished high school study and then moved to Bandung in 2007. He pursued bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at Institute of Technology Bandung (ITB). He graduated with honors in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Electronics and Control Systems. His final project in
Hardware-based Firewall Development in FPGA has been published in 2011 IEEE International Conference.</p>

            <p align="justify">Soon after he graduated, he received a scholarship to do research study of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) in National Central University (NCU) Taiwan in 2011. Arief was a master student and a teaching assistant in Physics department of NCU Taiwan. He was interested in laser technology and worked with LiDAR systems to develop wind speed measurement method. Even though his research in Taiwan was very interesting, Arief later realized that his passion is not in Atmospheric Science. In 2012, Arief decided to leave the program and go back to Indonesia to follow his passion in engineering.</p>

            <p align="justify">In 2013, Arief worked as IT consultant in a well known consultant firm for a while before continuing his study in France. With his former supervisor’s help when he was studying in ITB, he received Eiffel Scholarship from French government for an engineering program in Joseph Fourier University Grenoble. In Grenoble, he studied Informatique Industrielle et Instrumentation with specialization in Microelectronics Systems. During his first year in France, he had done internship in R&amp;D Department of Digigram, one of the biggest french provider in audio/video technology. His final-year internship was carried out in TIMA Laboratory with a subject in SoC-prototyping.</p>

            <p align="justify">Arief found his passion in SoC-prototyping while doing his internship and decided to apply for PhD position in TIMA. At the present time, he is pursuing PhD degree in System Level Synthesis Division of TIMA Laboratory Grenoble in Nano Electronics and Nano Technology. His topic is focused on High Performance Computing using cloud-FPGA environment. During his free time, Arief likes to travel and take photos. He is also one of the first contributors for <a href="index.html">Pandu.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Krisna Adi Pawitan</h2>
            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/501/20294312858_9d57c528bb_k.jpg" alt="Krisna Adi Pawitan" align="left" width="350px"              style="margin: 10px 20px">
            <p align="justify">Krisna Adi Pawitan was born in 1988 in Bogor, Indonesia. He spent most of his childhood in his hometown before eventually moved to Bandung to finish his Bachelor degree in mechanical engineering at Institute Technology of Bandung (ITB). During his bachelor study he got fascinated by the field of fluid dynamics and decided to focus his study in fluid dynamics field during his final year of the university.</p>

            <p align="justify">For his bachelor degree he did a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics approach of a turbo jet engine’s compressor designed by Dr. Firmah Hartono. He graduated from ITB in October 2011. In order to deeper his understanding of fluid dynamics, in 2012 he decided to continue his study in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) in Taipei, Taiwan.  Lucky enough, he got a scholarship from the university to do his master degree with a project in Thermal Fluid Dynamics field, which is of course very suitable for his interest. His project involved measuring the effect of natural frequency vibration in an elevated jet in cross flow’s mixing efficiency. In this project he learned how to use PIV, pressure transducer, high speed camera, and other similar measurement necessary for seeing the effect of the vibration to the fuel mixing efficiency. This experience further pushed his excitement for adding more knowledge in fluid dynamics. He graduated with honours from NTUST in January 2014.</p>

            <p align="justify">Still following his passion in science, he decided to become an adjunct lecturer in one of the best private university in Bandung, teaching Manufacturing Process to the second-year university student. During this time, he tried to apply for a Ph.D opportunity at some universities to further increase his understanding toward fluid dynamics. After looked through some Ph.D vacancies available he finally found one that enticed his curiosity the most. Currently, he is pursuing a Ph.D degree in University of Edinburgh (UoE), Scotland, one of the best universities in UK and in the world. He mainly focus on the marine renewable energy converter, specifically the oscillating water column. He believes that renewables energy is the answer to future energy problem and current carbon emission problem which cause global warming. He also believes that knowledge is not for one to keep, but for one to share and apply for the benefits of others. He is also one of the first contributors for <a href="index.html">Pandu.com</a>.</p>
